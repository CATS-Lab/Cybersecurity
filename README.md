# Security Strategy against Generalized Inter-Vehicle Cyberattacks in Car-following Scenarios for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code and data for the following paper:

**Zhou, H., Ma, C., Xinmeizi Cai, Ma, K., Li, X., \& Ran, B.** (2025). *Security strategy against generalized inter-vehicle cyberattacks in car-following scenarios for connected and autonomous vehicles.*

Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can improve safety and efficiency by sharing future driving intentions with nearby vehicles. However, overreliance on inter-vehicle communication may lead to critical safety risks when facing cyberattacks. This repository provides the implementation of a security-aware car-following control strategy under inter-vehicle cyberattacks, which dynamically adjusts its reliance on inter-vehicle information. The framework includes four control modes, a cyberattack misbehavior identification module, and two trajectory optimization models for connected and non-connected driving. We also include a cyberattack generation algorithm to simulate safety-critical attack scenarios and evaluate the proposed strategy's effectiveness.
